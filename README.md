Restaurant and Bar are in the market trend compared to other types where the other types are
doing fairly better though not as good as the top two .

![Top 10 streets by number of restaurants.](images/la_seat_street.png 'Top 10 streets by number of restaurants.')  
 

 <b>Looking at the top 10 streets with more number of restaurants in terms of average number of seats ,we don't
see much increase in seating though they are not either at very few seating category .the graph of Wilshire
shows increase in number of seating comparatively ..
So based on our analysis for top 10 streets ,we see that W.Sunset ,W.Pico ,Wilshire , Wilshire Blvd and
Hollywood seems to be some of the recommendation for our restaurant..
 
# Final Conclusion :
1.Based on our analysis on the LA restautants dataset , we see that 'Restaurant' and 'Fast Food' seems to
occupy way more proportion in the market compared to rest of the other types-cafe,Bar,Bakery,Pizza irrespective
of chain and non-chain..
2.But with our plan for a small robot-run cafe ,W.Sunset ,W.Pico and Wilshire Blvd and Hollywood are better
choices based on our analysis shown in 'street_establishment_count' dataset with average seating around 20s.
This makes it better choice for a new business in terms of finance also.
3.If interested in other types ,it is good to invest on Restaurants or Fast food around the same area with
average seating being 30-40. 4.For whichever type we go with ,being not in a chain is the most ideal one , atleast during the early days.
